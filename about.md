Remote sensing has greatly accelerated traditional archaeological landscape surveys in the forested regions of the ancient Maya. Typical exploration and discovery attempts, beside focusing on whole ancient cities, focus also on individual buildings and structures. Recently, there have been recent successful attempts of utilizing machine learning for  identifying ancient Maya settlements. These attempts, while relevant, focus on narrow areas and rely on high-quality aerial laser scanning (ALS) data which covers only a fraction of the region where ancient Maya were once settled. Satellite image data, on the other hand,  produced by the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel missions, is abundant and, more importantly, publicly available. 

In particular, the Sentinel-1 satellites  are equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operating globally with frequent revisit periods, while the the Sentinel-2 satellites are equipped with one of the most sophisticated optical sensors (MSI and SWIR), capturing imagery from visible to medium-infrared spectrum with a spatial resolution of 10-60m. While the latter has been shown to lead to accurate performance on a variety of remote sensing tasks, the data from the optical sensors is heavily dependent on the presence of cloud cover, therefore combining it with  radar data from the Sentinel-1 satellites provides an additional benefit. Integrating  Sentinel data has been shown to lead to improved performance for different tasks of land-use and land-cover classification. This is the goal of the challenge: 

*Explore the potential of the Sentinel satellite data (as well as making use of the available lidar data) for integrated image segmentation in order to locate and identify “lost” ancient Maya settlements(aguadas, platforms and buildings) hidden under the thick forest canopy.*

### Cometition prizes

The competition winners, as well as other competitors determined by the organizers, will be invited to present their work at the ECML PKDD 2021 Discovery Challenge.

The top-3 solutions, that outscore the baseline solution (provided by the orgnaiziers) will be awarded with:

1. 2000 EUR (1700+300*)
2. 1500 EUR (1200+300*)
3. 1000 EUR (700+300*)

\*additional 300 EUR will be awarded if the competitors used the AiTLAS toolbox in their solution or their implementation is fully compatible within AiTLAS (this is to be decided after code review post-competition)
